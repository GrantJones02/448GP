                <h2>Lesson Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                Welcome again to ChessEDU!<br>
                We're glad to have you.<br>
                <br>
                In this lesson, you will learn<br>
                how to start a game with another person<br>
                and how the game is won and lost.<br>
                <br>
                Please continue to the next page<br>
                to start this lesson.<br>

                <h2>Setting up the Board</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the lesson on the types of pieces,<br>
                    a board set up in the starting position was used.<br>
                    <br>
                    To provide a formal instruction, however,<br>
                    here are the basic steps to set up the board.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab2">
                <h2>Setting up the Board</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Each player has their own edge,<br>
                    where the leftmost square should be dark<br>
                    and the rightmost square should be light.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. The pawns go on the row in front of the edge.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. On each player's back row,<br>
                    in order from the corners to the center is<br>
                    rook, knight, bishop, and then king/queen.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Your queen starts on her own color.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h2>Opening The Game</h2>
                <p>
                    As you saw in the exercise on the previous page,<br>
                    not all of your pieces are able to be moved<br>
                    on the first turn.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pieces that cannot be moved in the current position<br>
                    are often called "inactive".<br>
                    <br>
                    Your active pieces at the beginning<br>
                    can be used to start the game with<br>
                    what is called an <i>opening</i>.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab5">
                <h2>Opening The Game</h2>
                <p>
                    The most common pieces to open with<br>
                    for both colors are<br>
                    <i>the E Pawn</i> (King's Pawn),<br>
                    <i>the D Pawn</i> (Queen's Pawn),<br>
                    and <i>the Knights</i>.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is because these pieces<br>
                    allow you to <i>activate</i><br>
                    other pieces on the board,<br>
                    and you can also use these pieces<br>
                    to <i>control the center</i>.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab6">
                <h2>Simple Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Mentioned in the previous section,<br>
                    one of the most important tactics<br>
                    is to control the center of the board.<br>
                    <br>
                    This allows you to make the most attacks<br>
                    against your opponent at once<br>
                    while also defending your king from danger.<br>
                    <br>
                    Your goal from here will be to land<br>
                    a <i>check</i>, or possibly even <i>checkmate</i><br>
                    against your opponent from an offensive position.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab7">
                <h2>Check</h2>
                <p>
                    Check is one of three special states<br>
                    that the board can be placed into by the players.<br>
                    <br>
                    Your king is <i>in check</i> if<br>
                    your opponent could capture your king<br>
                    on their next turn.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab8">
                <h2>Check</h2>
                <p>
                    When you are placed into check,<br>
                    you have to make a move that<br>
                    takes you out of check.<br>
                    <br>
                    Eliminating the threat to your king<br>
                    is not optional.<br>
                    <br>
                    The three common ways to do this are:<br>
                    1. Capturing the threatening piece<br>
                    2. Shielding with a different piece<br>
                    3. Moving your king<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab9">
                <h2>Checkmate</h2>
                <p>
                    When you are placed into check,<br>
                    but there is no move you can make<br>
                    that will remove you from check,<br>
                    you are in the second special board state:<br>
                    CHECKMATE.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you checkmate your opponent,<br>
                    you have won the game.<br>
                    <br>
                    Most checkmates involve trapping the king<br>
                    using the combined power of multiple pieces.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab10">
                <h2>Stalemate and Draws</h2>
                <p>
                    The third special board state<br>
                    is STALEMATE.<br>
                    <br>
                    Stalemate occurs when the player<br>
                    whose turn it is to move<br>
                    has no legal moves they can make.<br>
                    (Which happens more often that you might think!)<br>
                    <br>
                    This is also an end to the game,<br>
                    but neither player wins in this scenario.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you are winning, you want to avoid this outcome.<br>
                    If you are at risk of losing, on the other hand,<br>
                    sometimes your best outcome is try to<br>
                    force a stalemate instead.
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab11">
                <h2>Stalemate and Draws</h2>
                <p>
                    Stalemate is almost always caused<br>
                    by limiting the movement of the king.<br>
                    <br>
                    The king can never move into check,<br>
                    so if no other piece can move<br>
                    you can accidentally force a stalemate<br>
                    by boxing the king in without attacking him directly.<br>
                    <br>
                    The best way to avoid accidentally causing stalemate<br>
                    when you have an advantage over your opponent<br>
                    is to place them in check each turn.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can never be in <i>check</i> and <i>stalemate</i><br>
                    at the same time.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab12">
                <h2>Stalemate and Draws</h2>
                <p>
                    There are other ways to draw the game<br>
                    that are present in tournament styles of Chess.<br>
                    <br>
                    These are added to prevent certain strategies<br>
                    that involve waiting on your opponent to slip up<br>
                    rather than employing better strategy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>Three-fold repetition</i> is a rule added<br>
                    that forces a draw if the same position happens<br>
                    three times in a row.<br>
                    <br>
                    Similarly, the <i>fifty-turn rule</i> has been added<br>
                    to force a draw if players go fifty turns without<br>
                    changing the balance of power,<br>
                    either by one player capturing another's pieces<br>
                    or one player making a pawn move.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tab13">
                <h2>Optional Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    In chess tournaments,<br>
                    you will sometimes see a <i>chess clock</i> used.<br>
                    <br>
                    These start with a set time,<br>
                    that runs down only when you are on your turn.<br>
                    <br>
                    You start your clock when your turn begins,<br>
                    and only get to stop it when you make your move.<br>
                    <br>
                    These aren't often used in casual play,<br>
                    but if you want to learn how to play competitively<br>
                    it does not hurt to practice with one of these.<br>
